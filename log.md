### Day 1: November 7, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Merged the pull request.

**Thoughts** I need to spend some time exploring state management in React. It might not be important for the next feature I am about to implement, however I kept postponing it for way too long. I will take a look at Redux or Context.Provider. I hope it would not put me off the track. I am counting with skipping the coding day tomorrow.
